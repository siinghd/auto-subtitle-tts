1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Then the quiet shadow of hardship hope as a whisper, urging us to endure.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,760
 With each step through darkness, we move toward a dawn yet unseen.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,800
 Hold fast to dreams, foreign dreams, lies the strength to wake to brighter days.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,080
 Remember, after the longest night comes the warmth of the sunrise.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,960
 You are not alone, every sunrise is a promise, and new day to rediscover joy.

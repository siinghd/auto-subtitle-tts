1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
 And your brain is the most powerful weapon.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,440
 I talk about that in one of these chapters.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,240
 Your brain is the most powerful weapon in the world.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,480
 Once you put away your phones and your computers

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,120
 and all that shit we have nowadays, that's great.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,200
 We're up to date.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,320
 You know, but your brain is the only thing you have

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
 when you're going through depression,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,600
 when you're going through hard times,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,520
 you're going through death, real life shit.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,280
 You can't Google that shit, man.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,640
 You're alone.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,480
 You're alone.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,080
 You may have a shrink.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,680
 You're going to.

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,800
 You may have a best thing you're going to.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,440
 But there's 24 hours in the day where you're alone

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,680
 in this brain.

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,240
 And your brain is talking to you in all kinds of ways.

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,760
 And at once the control you're pulling these different pockets.

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,280
 If you can't control your own brain

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,120
 and your brain controls you, the fuck.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,920
 You got to tell your brain where you want to go

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,400
 and how you want to go and how you can get there.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,880
 You got to control it.

26
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,320
 If not, it's cool.
